        <h1 class="undr" style="text-align: center;">Ramanujan's Contribution to Mathematics</h1>
        <p>
            Ramanujan was also called "The Mystical Mathematician" and was also honoured with an FRS (Fellow of the Royal
            Society) which was a very big surprise as the FRS was being given to an Indian that too when India was under
            the British rule. Ramanujan gave various algorithms that are helping mathematicians and scientists even today.
            “The limitations of his knowledge were as startling as its profundity. Here was a man who could work out modular
            equations and theorems…to orders unheard of, whose mastery of continued fraction was… beyond that of any
            mathematician in the world, who had found for himself the functional equation of zeta function and the dominant
            terms of many of the most famous problems in analytical theory of numbers; and yet he had never heard of a doubly
            periodic function or of Cauchy’s theorem, and had indeed but the vaguest idea of what a function of complex variable
            was…”. Some of Ramanujan's most famous works are&RuleDelayed;<br>

                &diamondsuit; &pi;'s Value<br>
                Ramanujan compiled around 3,900 results consisting of equations and identities. One of his most treasured
                was his infinite series for pi. This series forms the basis of many algorithms we use today. He gave several
                fascinating formulas to calculate the digits of pi in many unconventional ways. Using his algorithms mathematicians
                have been able to calculate the value of pi to millions of decimal places.<br><br>
                &diamondsuit; Partition in Mathematics<br>
                Partition in maths is the number of ways that a positive integer can be expressed as the sum of positive integers,
                written as "p(x)=y". For example p(4)=5 as 1+1+1+1=4, 1+1+2=4, 1+3=4, 2+2=4, 4=4; similarly p(10)=42.
                Ramanujan gave formulae to determine the number of partitions of a particular number within a radius of
                4% errors which he further reduced 0.004% errors!!<br><br>
                &diamondsuit; Ramanujan-Hardy Number<br>
                1729 is known as the Ramanujan number. It is the sum of the cubes of two numbers 10 and 9. For instance, 1729
                results from adding 1000 (the cube of 10) and 729 (the cube of 9). This is the smallest number that can be
                expressed in two different ways as it is the sum of these two cubes. Interestingly, 1729 is a natural number.
                1729 is also sometimes reffered to as the the smallest number that can be expressed in two different ways as
                it is the sum of these two positive cubes, as on dicovery of negative numbers the smallest such number becomes
                91 as 6<sup>3</sup>+(-5)<sup>3</sup>=4<sup>3</sup>+3<sup>3</sup>=91.<br><br>
                &diamondsuit; Miscellaneous<br>
                >He elaborately described the mock theta function, which is a concept in the realm of modular form in
                 mathematics. Considered an enigma till sometime back, it is now recognized as holomorphic parts of mass
                 forms.<br>
                >He discovered a long list of new ideas to solve many challenging mathematical problems, which gave a significant
                impetus to the development of game theory. His contribution to game theory is purely based on intuition and
                natural talent and remains unrivalled to this day.<br>
                >Ramanujan’s contributions stretch across mathematics fields, including complex analysis, number theory, infinite
                series, and continued fractions, and are even helping scientists to study blackhole.<br>
                >Ramanujan gave meaning to the negative values of the gamma function.
