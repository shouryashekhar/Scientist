        <h1 class="undr" style="text-align: center;">Aryabhata's Contribution to Mathematics, Science, Astronomy</h1>
        <p class="unique">
            Aryabhata is the author of several treatises on mathematics and astronomy, some of which are lost.
            His major work, Aryabhatiya, a compendium of mathematics and astronomy, was extensively referred to in the Indian
            mathematical literature and has survived to modern times. The mathematical part of the Aryabhatiya covers arithmetic,
            algebra, plane trigonometry, and spherical trigonometry. It also contains continued fractions, quadratic equations,
            sums-of-power series, and a table of sines. The Arya-siddhanta, a lost work on astronomical computations, is known
            through the writings of Aryabhata's contemporary, Varahamihira, and later mathematicians and commentators, including
            Brahmagupta and Bhaskara I. This work appears to be based on the older Surya Siddhanta and uses the midnight-day
            reckoning, as opposed to sunrise in Aryabhatiya. It also contained a description of several astronomical
            instruments: the gnomon (shanku-yantra), a shadow instrument (chhAyA-yantra), possibly angle-measuring devices,
            semicircular and circular (dhanur-yantra / chakra-yantra), a cylindrical stick yasti-yantra, an umbrella-shaped
            device called the chhatra-yantra, and water clocks of at least two types, bow-shaped and cylindrical. A third
            text, which may have survived in the Arabic translation, is Al ntf or Al-nanf. It claims that it is a translation
            by Aryabhata, but the Sanskrit name of this work is not known. Probably dating from the 9th century, it is mentioned
            by the Persian scholar and chronicler of India, Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī. Some of Aryabhata's most famous
            works are&RuleDelayed;<br>

                    &diamond; Place value system and "zero":<br>
                    Aryabhata gave the place-value system to the world that made all the calculations very easy.
                    he also used new symbols for different numbers called the "Hindu-Arabic Numerical System"
                    (this system had found its way to Europe through the Arabian Gulf, thus "Arabic"). Also he
                    gave a symbol to denote "nothing" ie, "0". This was a huge breakthrough in mathematics, which
                    furher lead to the formation of "Binary Number System", that form the basics for the computers
                    that we use today.<br><br>
                    &diamond; Approximation of &pi;:<br>
                    Aryabhata worked on the approximation for pi (π), and may have come to the conclusion that π
                    is irrational. In the second part of the Aryabhatiyam (gaṇitapāda 10), he writes:
                </p>
                <p class="sub1" style="text-align: center;">चतुराधिकं शतमष्टगुणं द्वाषष्टिस्तथा सहस्त्राणाम्। अयुतद्वयस्य विष्कम्भस्य आसन्नौ वृत्तपरिणाहः</p>
                <p class="div1">
                    it translates to "Add four to 100, multiply by eight, and then add 62,000. By this rule the circumference of
                    a circle with a diameter of 20,000 can be approached". This implies that for a circle whose diameter is
                    20000, the circumference will be 62832 i.e, <sup>(62832)</sup>/<sub>(20000)</sub> = (3.1416), which is accurate to
                    three decimal places. It is speculated that Aryabhata used the word āsanna (approaching), to
                    mean that not only is this an approximation but that the value is incommensurable (or irrational).
                    If this is correct, it is quite a sophisticated insight, because the irrationality of pi (π) was
                    proved in Europe only in 1761 by Lambert. After Aryabhatiya was translated into Arabic (c. 820 CE)
                    this approximation was mentioned in Al-Khwarizmi's book on algebra.<br><br>
                    &diamond; Trigonometry:<br>
                    In Ganitapada 6, Aryabhata gives the area of a triangle as:
                </p>
                <p class="sub1" style="text-align: center;">त्रिभुजस्य फलशरीरं समदल कोटी भुजार्धासंवर्ग:</p>
                <p class="div1"> it translates to: "for a triangle, the result of a perpendicular with the half-side
                    is the area". Aryabhata discussed the concept of "sine" in his work by the name of
                    "ardha-jya", which literally means "half-chord". For simplicity, people started calling
                    it "jya". When Arabic writers translated his works from Sanskrit into Arabic, they referred
                    it as "jiba". However, in Arabic writings, vowels are omitted, and it was abbreviated as "jb".
                    Later writers substituted it with "jaib", meaning "pocket".
                    (In Arabic, "jiba" is a meaningless word.) Later in the 12th century, when Gherardo of Cremona
                    translated these writings from Arabic into Latin, he replaced the Arabic "jaib" with its Latin
                    counterpart, "sinus", which means "cove" or "bay"; thence comes the English word sine.<br><br>
                    &diamond; Indeterminate Equations:<br>
                    A problem of great interest to Indian mathematicians since ancient times has been to find integer
                    solutions to Diophantine equations that have the form ax + by = c.This is an example from Bhāskara's
                    commentary on Aryabhatiya: Find the number which gives 5 as the remainder when divided by 8, 4 as
                    the remainder when divided by 9, and 1 as the remainder when divided by 7. That is, find
                    N = 8x+5 = 9y+4 = 7z+1. It turns out that the smallest value for N is 85. In general, diophantine
                    equations, such as this, can be notoriously difficult. They were discussed extensively in
                    ancient Vedic text Sulba Sutras, whose more ancient parts might date to 800 BCE. Aryabhata's method of
                    solving such problems, elaborated by Bhaskara in 621 CE, is called the "kuṭṭaka (कुट्टक)"" method. "Kuṭṭaka"
                    means "pulverizing" or "breaking into small pieces", and the method involves a recursive algorithm for
                    writing the original factors in smaller numbers. This algorithm became the standard method for solving
                    first-order diophantine equations in Indian mathematics, and initially the whole subject of algebra was
                    called "kuṭṭaka-gaṇita" or simply "kuṭṭaka".<br><br>
                    &diamond; Algebra:<br>
                    In Aryabhatiya, Aryabhata provided elegant results for the summation of series of squares and cubes<br><br>
                </p>
                <p class="sub1" style="text-align: center;">1<sup>2</sup>+2<sup>2</sup>+.....+n<sup>2</sup> = <sup>[n(n+1)(2n+1)]</sup>/<sub>6</sub> <br><br> 1<sup>3</sup>+2<sup>3</sup>+.....+n<sup>3</sup> = (1+2+.....+n)<sup>2</p>

        <p class="unique">
            &diamondsuit; Astronomy<br>
            Aryabhata's system of astronomy was called the "audAyaka" system, in which days are reckoned from "uday" ie dawn at
            "lanka" ie equator. Some of his later writings on astronomy, which apparently proposed a second model
            (or "ardha-rAtrikA" ie midnight) are lost but can be partly reconstructed from the discussion in Brahmagupta's
            "Khandakhadyaka". In some texts, he seems to ascribe the apparent motions of the heavens to the Earth's
            rotation. He may have believed that the planet's orbits as elliptical rather than circular.<br>
        </p>
        <div>
            <p class="div1">
                &diamond; Motions of the Solar System:<br>
                Aryabhata correctly insisted that the earth rotates about its axis daily, and that the apparent movement
                of the stars is a relative motion caused by the rotation of the earth, contrary to the then-prevailing view,
                that the sky rotated. This is indicated in the first chapter of the Aryabhatiya, where he gives the number of
                rotations of the earth in a yuga, and made more explicit in his gola chapter:<br>
            </p>
            <p class="sub2">
                "In the same way that someone in a boat going forward sees an unmoving [object] going backward, so [someone] on
                the equator sees the unmoving stars going uniformly westward. The cause of rising and setting [is that] the
                sphere of the stars together with the planets [apparently?] turns due west at the equator, constantly pushed
                by the cosmic wind."<br>
            </p>
            <p class="div1">
                Aryabhata described a geocentric model of the solar system, in which the Sun and Moon are each carried by
                epicycles. They in turn revolve around the Earth. In this model, which is also found in the "Paitāmahasiddhānta"
                (c. CE 425), the motions of the planets are each governed by two epicycles, a smaller "manda" (slow) and a larger
                "śīghra" (fast). The order of the planets in terms of distance from earth is taken as: the Moon, Mercury, Venus,
                the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the asterisms.The positions and periods of the planets was calculated relative
                to uniformly moving points. In the case of Mercury and Venus, they move around the Earth at the same mean speed as
                the Sun. In the case of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, they move around the Earth at specific speeds, representing each
                planet's motion through the zodiac. Most historians of astronomy consider that this two-epicycle model reflects elements
                of pre-Ptolemaic Greek astronomy. Another element in Aryabhata's model, the śīghrocca, the basic planetary period in
                relation to the Sun, is seen by some historians as a sign of an underlying heliocentric model.<br><br>
                &diamond; Eclipses:<br>
                Solar and lunar eclipses were scientifically explained by Aryabhata. He states that the Moon and planets shine by
                reflected sunlight. Instead of the prevailing cosmogony in which eclipses were caused by Rahu and Ketu (identified
                as the pseudo-planetary lunar nodes), he explains eclipses in terms of shadows cast by and falling on Earth. Thus,
                the lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon enters into the Earth's shadow (verse gola.37). He discusses at length the
                size and extent of the Earth's shadow (verses gola.38–48) and then provides the computation and the size of the
                eclipsed part during an eclipse. Later Indian astronomers improved on the calculations, but Aryabhata's methods
                provided the core. His computational paradigm was so accurate that 18th-century scientist Guillaume Le Gentil,
                during a visit to Pondicherry, India, found the Indian computations of the duration of the lunar eclipse of
                30 August 1765 to be short by 41 seconds, whereas his charts (by Tobias Mayer, 1752) were long by 68 seconds.<br><br>
                &diamond; Sidereal Periods:<br>
                Considered in modern English units of time, Aryabhata calculated the sidereal rotation (the rotation of the
                earth referencing the fixed stars) as 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4.1 seconds; the modern value is 23:56:4.091.
                Similarly, his value for the length of the sidereal year at 365 days, 6 hours, 12 minutes, and 30 seconds
                (365.25858 days) is an error of 3 minutes and 20 seconds over the length of a year (365.25636 days).<br><br>
                &diamond; Heliocentrism:<br>
                As mentioned, Aryabhata advocated an astronomical model in which the Earth turns on its own axis. His model
                also gave corrections (the "śīgra anomaly") for the speeds of the planets in the sky in terms of the mean
                speed of the Sun. Thus, it has been suggested that Aryabhata's calculations were based on an underlying
                heliocentric model, in which the planets orbit the Sun, though this has been rebutted. It has also been
                suggested that aspects of Aryabhata's system may have been derived from an earlier, likely pre-Ptolemaic
                Greek, heliocentric model of which Indian astronomers were unaware, though the evidence is scant. The general
                consensus is that a "synodic anomaly" (depending on the position of the Sun) does not imply a physically heliocentric
                orbit (such corrections being also present in late Babylonian astronomical texts), and that Aryabhata's system was
                not explicitly heliocentric.

            This book is also called "Arya-shatas-ashta" which is directly translated as "Aryabhata's 108" because in the
            text there are 108 verses. It is written in the form of a sutra that is a collection of aphorisms which is a concise way
            of writing a statement or a scientific principle. These verses are his works that are a way to remember the complex
            calculations in a simple format, in the form of 13 introductory verses. These are divided into 4 chapters or padas, the
            1st Chapter is Gitikapada that has 13 verses. It deals with cosmology. The planetary revolutions, in a maha yuga, is
            mentioned to be up to 4.32 million years. The 2nd Pada or chapter is the Ganitapada, Ganita in Sanskrit means calculations.
            It has 33 verses, all dedicated to mathematics. Explaining, mensuration, simple, quadratic, and indeterminate equations and
            arithmetic and geometric equations. The 3rd Pada is the Kalakriya Pada consisting of 25 verses, where using varying units of
            time the count of days, wees and months. And the 4th Chapter is Golapada that consists of 50 verses. In this chapter, Aryabhata
            delves into the causes of days and nights, rising of zodiac signs, eclipse, celestial equator, node and the shape of the earth.
            This book contains both mathematical and astronomical discoveries.

                &diamond;Mathematical discoveries:<br>
                In Aryabhatiya Indian Mathematical Literature was extensively mentioned. The Vedic way to solve mathematical problems was explored
                and unsurprisingly this has also survived to modern times. The details of algebra, arithmetic, plane trigonometry. spherical
                trigonometry were discussed. He followed the Sanskrutik tradition or method of calculations that were prevalent in the Vedic Times.
                The title of 'Father Of Algebra' was given to Aryabhata, due to his notable understanding and explanation of planetary systems using it.
                Aryabhata correctly concluded the value of pi up to 2 decimal places, 3.14. He also used null coefficients and very rightly was aware of
                the use of zero in such a place. He used Sanskritic tradition that was mainly denoted by letters and alphabets, unlike the Brahmi numerals.<br><br>
                &diamond;Astronomical discoveries:<br>
                Aryabhatta rightly insisted that the earth rotates daily on its own axis around the sun and the movement of stars appeared to be because
                of the relative motion caused due to rotation of the earth. This was in contrast to the then very popular belief that it was the sky that
                rotates. Rightly with calculated evidence, it was explained heliocentrism is the rotation of planets around the sun, axially. The geocentric
                model of the solar system was described by Aryabhata, scientifically explaining the solar and lunar eclipses. He also estimated the length of
                the year to be 365 days 6 hours 12 minutes 30 seconds which only deviates from today's calculations by 3 minutes 20 seconds.
