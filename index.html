        <h1>&blacksquare; Srinivasa Ramanujan FRS - The Man Who Knew Infinity</h1>
        <h5><img class="rmn" src="srinivasa_ramanujan.jpg" alt="Srinivasa Ramanujan">&bullet;Biography</h5>
        <p class="bio1">Srinivasa Ramanujan FRS was born on 22 December 1887, in a small village of Erode (near
            Madras), Tamil Nadu (the then Madras Presidency), India and was destined to become one of the
            greatest mathematicians ever. He was an Indian-born mathematician though he no prior education of
            maths but he suceeded in formulating formulas for the then seeming impossible cases. He originally
            created some of his theories while in India, though when he travelled to Cambridge in England to
            discuss his mathematical formulas with the brightest minds of the time. It was in England that
            Ramanujan began an inspirational partnership with the Cambridge professor Godfrey Harold Hardy.
            Professor Hardy realised that Ramanujan had discovered certain mathematical most of his theories
            have been proven correct over time and have provided mathematicians since then with the basis from
            which to create formulas that continue to shape science today. Hardy himself said, "I owe more to
            him than anyone else in this world..........and I had always wondered how did he get his ideas as he
            formulated almost correct formulas, but without any proofs!." Ramanujan told Hardy that it is his god,
            Namagiri who who put formulas in his head while he pray, or sleep. He died on 26 April 1920, Kumbakonam,
            Tamil Nadu, India at the age of 33 due to contracted tuberculosis.

        <h5>&bullet;Contribution to Mathematics</h5>
        <p>Ramanujan was also called "The Mystical Mathematician" and was also honoured with an FRS (Fellow of the Royal
            Society) which was a very big surprise as the FRS was being given to an Indian that too when India was under
            the British rule. Ramanujan gave various algorithms that are helping mathematicians and scientists even today.
            “The limitations of his knowledge were as startling as its profundity. Here was a man who could work out modular
            equations and theorems…to orders unheard of, whose mastery of continued fraction was… beyond that of any
            mathematician in the world, who had found for himself the functional equation of zeta function and the dominant
            terms of many of the most famous problems in analytical theory of numbers; and yet he had never heard of a doubly
            periodic function or of Cauchy’s theorem, and had indeed but the vaguest idea of what a function of complex variable
            was…”. Some of Ramanujan's most famous works are&RuleDelayed;<br>
            &utrif; &pi;'s Value<br>
            Ramanujan compiled around 3,900 results consisting of equations and identities. One of his most treasured
            was his infinite series for pi. This series forms the basis of many algorithms we use today. He gave several
            fascinating formulas to calculate the digits of pi in many unconventional ways. Using his algorithms mathematicians
            have been able to calculate the value of pi to millions of decimal places.<br>
            &utrif;Partition in Mathematics<br>
            Partition in maths is the number of ways that a positive integer can be expressed as the sum of positive integers,
            written as "p(x)=y". For example p(4)=5 as 1+1+1+1=4, 1+1+2=4, 1+3=4, 2+2=4, 4=4; similarly p(10)=42.
            Ramanujan gave formulae to determine the number of partitions of a particular number within a radius of
            4% errors which he further reduced 0.004% errors!!<br>
            &utrif;Ramanujan-Hardy Number<br>
            1729 is known as the Ramanujan number. It is the sum of the cubes of two numbers 10 and 9. For instance, 1729
            results from adding 1000 (the cube of 10) and 729 (the cube of 9). This is the smallest number that can be
            expressed in two different ways as it is the sum of these two cubes. Interestingly, 1729 is a natural number.
            1729 is also sometimes reffered to as the the smallest number that can be expressed in two different ways as
            it is the sum of these two positive cubes, as on dicovery of negative numbers the smallest such number becomes
            91 as 6<sup>3</sup>+(-5)<sup>3</sup>=4<sup>3</sup>+3<sup>3</sup>=91.<br>
            &utrif;Miscellaneous<br>
            >He elaborately described the mock theta function, which is a concept in the realm of modular form in
             mathematics. Considered an enigma till sometime back, it is now recognized as holomorphic parts of mass
             forms.<br>
            >He discovered a long list of new ideas to solve many challenging mathematical problems, which gave a significant
            impetus to the development of game theory. His contribution to game theory is purely based on intuition and
            natural talent and remains unrivalled to this day.<br>
            >Ramanujan’s contributions stretch across mathematics fields, including complex analysis, number theory, infinite
            series, and continued fractions, and are even helping scientists to study blackhole.<br>
            >Ramanujan gave meaning to the negative values of the gamma function.

        <h1>&blacksquare; Albert Einstein - The Man Who Used The Most Percentage Of His Brain</h1>
        <h5><img class="albert" src="albert_einstein.jpg" alt="Albert Einstein">&bullet;Biography</h5>
        <p class="bio3">Albert Einstein was born on 14 March, 1879. He was a german-born physicist
            who developed the special and general theories of relativity and won the Nobel Prize for
            Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. Einstein is generally
            considered the most influential physicist of the 20th century. Albert attended a Catholic
            elementary school in Munich, from the age of five, for three years. At the age of eight,
            he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium, where he received advanced primary and secondary
            school education until he left the German Empire seven years later. In 1894, Hermann and Jakob's
            company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the
            capital to convert their equipment from the direct current (DC) standard to the more efficient
            alternating current (AC) standard. The loss forced the sale of the Munich factory. In search
            of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to Milan and a few months later to Pavia.
            When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein, then 15, stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the
            Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering, but Einstein
            clashed with the authorities and resented the school's regimen and teaching method.He died on 18 April,
            1955 at the age of 76 in New Jersey, United States

        <h5>&bullet;Contribution to Science</h5>
        <p>Albert Einstein is thought to have been a genius, and he is considered one of the world's greatest
            thinkers. Although he isn't known for inventions, as with Thomas Edison or Nikola Tesla, Einstein's
            theories and ideas related to physics continue to exert influence today. He spent much of his life
            researching theories of relativity, investigating space, time, matter, and energy. The following are
            the most singnificant theories of Albert Einstein&RuleDelayed;<br>
            &utrif; Quantum Theory of Light<br>
            Einstein proposed his theory of light, stating that all light is composed of tiny packets of 
            energy, called photons. He suggested these photons were particles but also had wave-like properties,
            a totally new idea at the time. He also spent some time outlining the emission of electrons from metals
            as they were hit with large electric pulses, like lightning. He expanded on this concept of the
            photoelectric effect, which we'll discuss later in this article.<br>
            &utrif; Special Theory of Relativity<br>
            In Einstein's studies, he began to notice inconsistencies of Newtonian mechanics in their relation
            to the understanding of electromagnetism, specifically to Maxwell's equations. In a paper published in
            September 1905, he proposed a new way of thinking about the mechanics of objects approaching the speed of
            light. This concept became known as Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity. It changed the understanding
            of physics at the time. Einstein’s revelation was that observers in relative motion experience time differently.
            He realized that it is possible for two events to happen simultaneously from the perspective of one observer,
            but occur at different times from the perspective of the other. And both observers would be right.
            Understanding the Special Theory of Relativity can be a little difficult, but we'll boil it down to a simple
            situation. He began with the idea that light always travels at a constant 300,000 km/s, and asked what would
            happen to our ideas of space and time if that was the case?<br>
            Now, imagine that you once again have an observer standing on a railway embankment as a train goes by, and
            that each end of the train is struck by a bolt of lightning just as the train’s midpoint is passing the
            observer. Because the lightning strikes are the same distance from the observer, their light reaches his eye
            at the same instant. So the observer would say the two strikes happened simultaneously. However, there is
            another observer, this on the train, sitting at its exact midpoint. Because the train is moving, the light
            coming from the lightning in the rear has to travel farther to catch up, so it reaches this observer later
            than the light coming from the front. This observer would conclude the one in front actually happened first.
            And both observers would be correct. And this is where he formulated the equation "E=mc<sup>2</sup>"<br>
            &utrif; Bose-Einstein Condensate<br>
            In 1924, Einstein was sent a paper from physicist Satyendra Nath Bose. This paper discussed a detailed way to
            think of photons of light as a gas. Einstein generalized Bose’s theory to an ideal gas of identical atoms or
            molecules for which the number of particles is conserved. Einstein worked with Bose to extend this idea to
            atoms, which led to a prediction for a new state of matter: the Bose-Einstein Condensate. The first example of
            this state was produced in 1995.<br>
            He also predicted that at sufficiently low temperatures, the particles would become locked together in the
            lowest quantum state of the system. This phenomenon is called Bose-Einstein condensation. A Bose-Einstein
            condensate is essentially a group of atoms that are cooled very close to absolute zero (0 Kelvin). When they
            reach that temperature, they hardly move in relation to one another. They begin to clump together and enter into
            exactly the same energy states. This means that, from a physical point of view, the group of atoms behaves as if
            they were a single atom We now know that this only happens for “bosons” — particles with a total spin that is an
            integer multiple of h, the Planck constant divided by 2 pi.<br>
            &utrif; Special Theory of Relativity<br>
            In 1916, Einstein published his General Theory of Relativity. This paper generalizes the concepts of Special
            Relativity and Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, describing gravity as a property of space and time. This
            theory has aided our understanding of how the large-scale structure of the universe is set up.<br>
            While Newton helped quantify gravity between two objects as a tugging of two bodies, independent of how massive
            each one is or how far apart they are, Einstein determined that the laws of physics hold constant for all
            non-accelerating observers, that the speed of light is constant no matter how fast the observer travels.
            He found that space and time were interwoven and that events that occur at one time for one observer could occur
            at a different time for the next. This led to his theory that massive objects in space could distort spacetime.
