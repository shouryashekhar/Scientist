        <h1>ALBERT EINSTEIN</h1>
        <h5>Date of Birth: 14 March 1879, Germany&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Date of Death: 18 April 1955(aged 76), USA</h5>
        <p class="albert"><img src="albert einstein.jpg" alt="Albert Einstein" align="right">&bullet; Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest
            physicists of all time. <br> Einstein is known for developing the theory of relativity and gave the famous
            equation E = mc<sup>2</sup>; relativity and quantum mecha-<br>-nics are together the two pillars of modern physics.
            His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He <br> received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his
            services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of <br>  the photoelectric effect, a pivotal step
            in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality res-<br>-ulted in "Einstein" becoming
            synonymous with "genius".</p>
