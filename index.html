        <h5><img class="rmn" src="srinivasa_ramanujan.jpg" alt="Srinivasa Ramanujan">&bullet;Biography</h5>
        <p class="bio1">Srinivasa Ramanujan FRS was born on 22 December 1887, in a small village of Erode (near
            Madras), Tamil Nadu (the then Madras Presidency), India and was destined to become one of the
            greatest mathematicians ever. He was an Indian-born mathematician though he no prior education of
            maths but he suceeded in formulating formulas for the then seeming impossible cases. He originally
            created some of his theories while in India, though when he travelled to Cambridge in England to
            discuss his mathematical formulas with the brightest minds of the time. It was in England that
            Ramanujan began an inspirational partnership with the Cambridge professor Godfrey Harold Hardy.
            Professor Hardy realised that Ramanujan had discovered certain mathematical most of his theories
            have been proven correct over time and have provided mathematicians since then with the basis from
            which to create formulas that continue to shape science today. Hardy himself said, "I owe more to
            him than anyone else in this world..........and I had always wondered how did he get his ideas as he
            formulated almost correct formulas, but without any proofs!." Ramanujan told Hardy that it is his god,
            Namagiri who who put formulas in his head while he pray, or sleep. He died on 26 April 1920, Kumbakonam,
            Tamil Nadu, India at the age of 33 due to contracted tuberculosis.

        <h1>&blacksquare; <a href="arya_bhata.html">Aryabhata - The Man Who Taught Us Even Nothing Values</a></h1>
        <h5><img class="arya" src="aryabhata.jpg" alt="Aryabhata">&bullet;Biography</h5>
        <p class="bio2">Aryabhata born in Patliputra (now Patna), Bihar, India in the year 476 AD was the first
            of the major mathematician-astronomers from the classical age of Indian mathematics and Indian
            astronomy. A verse mentions that Aryabhata was the head of an institution (kulapa)
            at Kusumapura, and, because the university of Nalanda was in Pataliputra at the time and had an astronomical
            observatory, it is speculated that Aryabhata might have been the head of the Nalanda university as well.
            Aryabhata is also reputed to have set up an observatory at the Sun temple in Taregana, Bihar. Pataliputra
            which was the capital of Kusumapura in the Gupta Empire was a major learning hub and was the centre of a
            communication network. Because of which the works around the world reached the place easily that helped
            Aryabhata to make major mathematical and astronomical advancements. It was believed that he was the head of
            his school Kulpa in Kusumapura. And later to pursue his interest in astronomy also went to study at Nalanda
            University located in Pataliputra, the speculations of him being the head of his university also remained
            intact.The legacy of Aryabhata is truly unmatched, and no one is able to replicate his major achievements
            at a world-class level that is relevant to this day ever since.</p><br><br><br>
        
        <h1>&blacksquare; <a href="albert_einstein.html">Albert Einstein - The Man Who Used The Most Percentage Of His Brain</a></h1>
        <h5><img class="albert" src="albert_einstein.jpg" alt="Albert Einstein">&bullet;Biography</h5>
        <p class="bio3">Albert Einstein was born on 14 March, 1879. He was a german-born physicist
            who developed the special and general theories of relativity and won the Nobel Prize for
            Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. Einstein is generally
            considered the most influential physicist of the 20th century. Albert attended a Catholic
            elementary school in Munich, from the age of five, for three years. At the age of eight,
            he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium, where he received advanced primary and secondary
            school education until he left the German Empire seven years later. In 1894, Hermann and Jakob's
            company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the
            capital to convert their equipment from the direct current (DC) standard to the more efficient
            alternating current (AC) standard. The loss forced the sale of the Munich factory. In search
            of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to Milan and a few months later to Pavia.
            When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein, then 15, stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the
            Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering, but Einstein
            clashed with the authorities and resented the school's regimen and teaching method.He died on 18 April,
            1955 at the age of 76 in New Jersey, United States
