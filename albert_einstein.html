        <h1 class="undr" style="text-align: center;">Einstein's Contribution to Science</h1>
        <p>Albert Einstein is thought to have been a genius, and he is considered one of the world's greatest
            thinkers. Although he isn't known for inventions, as with Thomas Edison or Nikola Tesla, Einstein's
            theories and ideas related to physics continue to exert influence today. He spent much of his life
            researching theories of relativity, investigating space, time, matter, and energy. The following are
            the most singnificant theories of Albert Einstein&RuleDelayed;<br>
            &diamondsuit; Quantum Theory of Light<br>
            Einstein proposed his theory of light, stating that all light is composed of tiny packets of 
            energy, called photons. He suggested these photons were particles but also had wave-like properties,
            a totally new idea at the time. He also spent some time outlining the emission of electrons from metals
            as they were hit with large electric pulses, like lightning. He expanded on this concept of the
            photoelectric effect, which we'll discuss later in this article.<br><br>
            &diamondsuit; Special Theory of Relativity<br>
            In Einstein's studies, he began to notice inconsistencies of Newtonian mechanics in their relation
            to the understanding of electromagnetism, specifically to Maxwell's equations. In a paper published in
            September 1905, he proposed a new way of thinking about the mechanics of objects approaching the speed of
            light. This concept became known as Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity. It changed the understanding
            of physics at the time. Einstein’s revelation was that observers in relative motion experience time differently.
            He realized that it is possible for two events to happen simultaneously from the perspective of one observer,
            but occur at different times from the perspective of the other. And both observers would be right.
            Understanding the Special Theory of Relativity can be a little difficult, but we'll boil it down to a simple
            situation. He began with the idea that light always travels at a constant 300,000 km/s, and asked what would
            happen to our ideas of space and time if that was the case?<br>
            Now, imagine that you once again have an observer standing on a railway embankment as a train goes by, and
            that each end of the train is struck by a bolt of lightning just as the train’s midpoint is passing the
            observer. Because the lightning strikes are the same distance from the observer, their light reaches his eye
            at the same instant. So the observer would say the two strikes happened simultaneously. However, there is
            another observer, this on the train, sitting at its exact midpoint. Because the train is moving, the light
            coming from the lightning in the rear has to travel farther to catch up, so it reaches this observer later
            than the light coming from the front. This observer would conclude the one in front actually happened first.
            And both observers would be correct. And this is where he formulated the equation "E=mc<sup>2</sup>"<br><br>
            &diamondsuit; Bose-Einstein Condensate<br>
            In 1924, Einstein was sent a paper from physicist Satyendra Nath Bose. This paper discussed a detailed way to
            think of photons of light as a gas. Einstein generalized Bose’s theory to an ideal gas of identical atoms or
            molecules for which the number of particles is conserved. Einstein worked with Bose to extend this idea to
            atoms, which led to a prediction for a new state of matter: the Bose-Einstein Condensate. The first example of
            this state was produced in 1995.<br>
            He also predicted that at sufficiently low temperatures, the particles would become locked together in the
            lowest quantum state of the system. This phenomenon is called Bose-Einstein condensation. A Bose-Einstein
            condensate is essentially a group of atoms that are cooled very close to absolute zero (0 Kelvin). When they
            reach that temperature, they hardly move in relation to one another. They begin to clump together and enter into
            exactly the same energy states. This means that, from a physical point of view, the group of atoms behaves as if
            they were a single atom We now know that this only happens for “bosons” — particles with a total spin that is an
            integer multiple of h, the Planck constant divided by 2 pi.<br><br>
            &diamondsuit; Special Theory of Relativity<br>
            In 1916, Einstein published his General Theory of Relativity. This paper generalizes the concepts of Special
            Relativity and Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, describing gravity as a property of space and time. This
            theory has aided our understanding of how the large-scale structure of the universe is set up.<br>
            While Newton helped quantify gravity between two objects as a tugging of two bodies, independent of how massive
            each one is or how far apart they are, Einstein determined that the laws of physics hold constant for all
            non-accelerating observers, that the speed of light is constant no matter how fast the observer travels.
            He found that space and time were interwoven and that events that occur at one time for one observer could occur
            at a different time for the next. This led to his theory that massive objects in space could distort spacetime.
